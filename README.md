A basic SpringBoot CRUD application to manage student metadata. It is created using Java 8, MySQL and Hibernate.

Set-up:

1. You will need an IDE : I've used IntelliJ, java 8, MySQL server and workbench, Postman (for testing out the APIs).
2. Clone the project onto your local folder and open it up in the IDE. 
3. In the application.properties, update your Database name, username and password. 
4. Set-up your database by creating the table 'student' with the columns mentioned in the Student.java class (enable the AutoIncrement and Primary Key option for ID during table creation). 
5. Run the application from AppApplication.java class, once the application boots up on port 8080 (as mentioned in application.properties), you can start testing your APIs through postman. 
6. Link to postman test API collection : https://www.getpostman.com/collections/8819464eb2ec1a440e33 

You are all done !
